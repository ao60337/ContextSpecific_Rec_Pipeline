# Tissue-specific Reconstruction Pipeline
A generic pipeline to reconstruct context-specific models using Troppo.

## Usage
To run the pipeline, run 'troppo_reconstruction_pipeline.py' script.
This pipeline requires some arguments to be passed to it, which can be adapted to the user's needs in 
three different files:
* 'utils/config_variables.py' - contains the configuration of the pipeline.
* 'utils/medium_variables.py' - contains the medium composition to be used by the model.
* 'utils/pipeline_paths.py' - contains the paths to be using by the pipeline. Including, model files, data files, and output paths.
